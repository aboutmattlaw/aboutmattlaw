ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I have over 20 years of experience in varied roles across online content, commerce, community and health tech. I've established product vision and software development processes at leading brands including Spring Health, Bonobos and Warby Parker. I'm a recent Flatiron School fullstack engineering program graduate.

While reflecting on and revisting what I learned during my time at Flatiron, I have been working on small projects that solve issues I face in my daily life. 

I'm looking to jump back into a fulltime role in product management or engineering that allows me to continue my technical development with the help and support of a strong team.
